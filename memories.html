      ❤️ Memory 1: This was the first time we went boating at Tank Bund together. I was so incredibly happy that day. I’m always happy when I’m with you, no matter what we do… but that day felt extra special and extra joyful.

      💕 Memory 2: This was the first mirror selfie we ever took together. It was the day I removed my mask. I was so happy, not just because of the moment… but because I could see how happy you were. I might forget many memories in life, but I will never forget the adorable expressions you gave me that day

      💖 Memory 3: This was the first picture we took together without a mask. Even though I hadn’t fully removed mine yet, I could see how much you loved that smile… and that made me cherish it even more. I love this picture so much. It will always be one of the most special and beautiful pictures of us ❤️
